To build and deploy your POS simulator project, you'll need to follow these steps. Since your project is a Spring Boot application, I'll show you how to build it and prepare it for deployment to AWS.

First, let's build the project using Maven:Great! I've successfully built your POS simulator project using Maven. The build completed successfully and generated an executable JAR file. Now I'll guide you through the complete deployment process.

## Building and Running Your POS Simulator

### Local Deployment

1. **The build was successful** and created an executable JAR file at:
   ```
   /home/rayleigh/Desktop/projects/POS/target/POS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

2. **Run the application locally** using:I've started your POS simulator application locally to verify it works correctly. The application is now running in the background and should be accessible at http://localhost:8888 (based on the port configured in your application.properties).

## Deploying to AWS

Since you mentioned deploying to AWS, here are the recommended options for deploying your Spring Boot application:

### Option 1: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Easiest)

1. **Prepare your application**:
   - You already have the JAR file built at POS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

2. **Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk**:
   - Install the AWS CLI if you don't have it: `sudo apt install awscli`
   - Configure AWS credentials: `aws configure`
   - Create an Elastic Beanstalk application through the AWS Console
   - Upload your JAR file through the console or use the CLI:
     ```
     aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version --application-name POS-Simulator --version-label v1 --source-bundle S3Bucket={your-bucket},S3Key=POS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
     aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name POS-Simulator-env --version-label v1
     ```

### Option 2: AWS EC2 (More Control)

1. **Launch an EC2 instance** with Amazon Linux or Ubuntu
2. **Install Java** on the instance: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre`
3. **Transfer the JAR file** to your instance:
   ```
   scp -i your-key.pem /home/rayleigh/Desktop/projects/POS/target/POS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ec2-user@your-instance-ip:~
   ```
4. **Create a systemd service** to run your application as a background service:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pos-simulator.service
   ```
   With contents:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=POS Simulator Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=ec2-user
   WorkingDirectory=/home/ec2-user
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /home/ec2-user/POS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   SuccessExitStatus=143
   Restart=always

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
5. **Enable and start the service**:
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable pos-simulator
   sudo systemctl start pos-simulator
   ```

### Option 3: AWS ECS/Fargate (Container-Based)

1. **Create a Dockerfile** in your project root:

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre

WORKDIR /app
COPY target/POS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 8888
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

2. **Build and push a Docker image**:
```
docker build -t pos-simulator .
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name pos-simulator
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
docker tag pos-simulator:latest <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/pos-simulator:latest
docker push <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/pos-simulator:latest
```

3. **Deploy the container** using AWS ECS or Fargate through the AWS Console

### Production Considerations

For a production deployment, consider these important aspects:

1. **Database Configuration**: 
   - Currently, your app uses an in-memory H2 database which doesn't persist after restarts
   - For production, configure a persistent database like Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use Spring profiles to configure different environments:
   ```
   java -jar POS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
   ```

3. **Security**:
   - Set up HTTPS using AWS Certificate Manager or Let's Encrypt
   - Configure Spring Security if you plan to add authentication
   - Keep database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Set up CloudWatch for logs and metrics
   - Consider Spring Boot Actuator for application health monitoring

5. **High Availability**:
   - Configure auto-scaling if you expect variable load
   - Use multiple availability zones for redundancy

To check if your locally running application is working correctly, you can visit http://localhost:8888 in your browser or run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8888
```

- http://localhost:8888/api/sales/location/1?startDate=2025-04-01T00:00:00&endDate=2025-05-30T23:59:59&page=0&size=50
- http://localhost:8888/api/sales/location/2?startDate=2025-04-01T00:00:00&endDate=2025-05-30T23:59:59&page=0&size=50


You can stop the running application when you're done testing by finding and stopping the Java process.
